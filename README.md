## Getting Started
Automatic Parking Management and Parking Fee Collection System (APMS) is a project aimed to deliver a contactless solution by automating the process of managing public car parking lots. By using a combination of car detection, license plate recognition (LPR), and a mobile application, the process of checking in/out of a car park can be done without the needs for other tools such as RFID cards or hand-written tickets, thus create a less time-consuming and more secured parking experience for customers.

This mobile application is a part of the project, provided for the customers using the APMS system. 

## Main Features
- Book a parking slot in advanced
- Scan QR to perform check-in/out process
- Track past, current and upcoming parking tickets
- Search and display nearby parking lots, with an approximate distance calculated using GPS
- Personal wallet top-up using Paypal
